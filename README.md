CommentBotShell
===============

The shell of a reddit comment bot, free for anyone to use. It follows a specific user, checking for new comments posted by that user, and replies to their comments with whatever text you want.

You will need to have python and praw installed on the machine you wish to run this on.

The comments detail what you need to replace to make it run to your specifications.
